## Emergency funding for the media

_Reporters Respond is an emergency fund for journalists and is managed by Free Press Unlimited. The fund is meant to help journalists who have been confronted with vandalism or intimidations get started again as soon as possible._

Around the world, members of the press face an increasing level of repression, violence and intimidation by governments, interest groups, militia and other parties. Unfortunately, for many journalists working in troubled areas, such threats are a daily reality. Many lose their equipment, their offices and sometimes even their lives.

To help assaulted reporters continue their vital work, Free Press Unlimited has launched Reporters Respond. This international emergency fund provides direct assistance to journalists and media outlets, enabling them to resume work as quickly as possible when faced with local obstruction. Support is provided irrespective of the medium and the area covered by the journalist or outlet.
